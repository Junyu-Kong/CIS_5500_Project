# CIS_5500_Project

Our project aims to build a Yelp-style web application PENN Yelp that empowers users to discover and evaluate local businesses. Visitors can search for establishments by location or category, explore detailed reviews and ratings, and make more informed decisions about where to eat or socialize.
Beyond the core Yelp functionality—business information page for individual businesses, posting ratings and writing reviews—we’ve introduced several analytics-driven features to enhance user insight and engagement:
- Time-Series Rating Trends: Visualize how an establishment’s average rating evolves over time.
- Comparative Reputation Analysis: Compare a restaurant’s performance to its peers within the same city.
- Engagement Leaderboard: Recognize and rank users by the number of reviews and tips they contribute, encouraging active participation

The underlying problem we address is that many people lack easy access to deeper, data-driven insights when choosing a place to dine or visit. By layering time-series analysis and gamification elements on top of traditional review browsing, our platform not only provides richer decision-making tools but also fosters greater community engagement than existing services.
