      "Good authentic Cuban food. I always get the cafe con leche to go!! Prices are reasonable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                4\n",
      "Read the good reviews and wanted to come in because I love Lebanese. I had the Lebanese special and my friend had the Venezuelan. The gyro was fresh and tasty and so was the pulled beef. \\n\\nThe sandwiches were approx. 7 dollars each which is a steal for the quality they give you. \\n\\n\\nOnly reason I gave four and not five stars is because there was only one person making the sandwiches and so it took some 10 minutes to take our order even though there was no line                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     3\n",
      "I wanted to reserve a review until after my second time there, so here I am. \\n\\nStellar service. Clean shop. Nice employees. Great selection of colors. Never too crowded. \\n\\nThe last time I was there was three weeks and my nails lasted beautifully. No chips. No cracks. No peels. Nothing. So, that's what prompted me to come back. \\n\\nMy only gripe: parking. The nail salon shares a building with a daycare, dance studio, hair salon and something else so during the week, parking is tough. Weekends are much easier. \\n\\nYou won't be disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     3\n",
      "First let me start by saying I have been doing business with West Side Mowers since 1993 and have never experienced a problem. I feel their prices can be a little on the high side but ok.\\nMy problem started when I dropped my mower off last summer to install a belt. Shortly after I received a call that there was a tiny spot on a pulley bracket that needed to be welded. I was quoted a price of around $300.00 to spot weld and install a new belt which I provided. I felt this was a little pricey so I went to pick my mower up and have a friend do the weld. I arrived a few minutes after they closed and the technician said I would have to come back. Well, time passed and I forgot to go back for my mower. I called to have them make the repair and they said they threw my mower out. I was shocked and said why didn't you call. They claimed they made numerous call to my house which my wife and I never received. I ask the owner, couldn't you drop a note in the mail? I certainly would have rushed to pick it up if I new they were going to trash it. The owner claims the mower wasn't worth the repair and the deck was rusted out. Not true! My mower was very well taken care of and in very good condition. I said to the owner if my mower was in such bad condition why would you have given me a quote to repair it. Well we went round and round until I realized there was no way I was going to convince him he must have been talking about someone else's mower. I clean and wax my mower at the end of each season to give you an idea of what kind of person I am. \\nI admit It was wrong not to have followed up sooner but  to trash someone's property without a simple note in the mail is wrong.\\nThis speaks volumes about a persons character as well as their business practices. My advise, find another repair shop to do business with!    3\n",

      "I ate here many months ago and my mind still goes back to think of the refreshing taste of that wonderful sashimi. \\n\\nThe night after eating there I dreamt they knit me a sweater vest out of sashimi. I devoured it in front of their eyes. They kicked me out on account of the no shirt no shoes policy...but it was worth it.

      "This is a great breakfast spot! Our service was great and our servers were friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. I ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict's and WOW. It was incredibly well seasoned and delicious. We were able to be seated right away, but there was a slight wait after we arrived.
